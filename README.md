# Drum Machine App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Used resources:
- Use Sound Hook - https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound
- Use event listener - https://github.com/donavon/use-event-listener
- Styled Components;
- React-range-slider - https://github.com/whoisandy/react-rangeslider#readme
- React-switch - https://github.com/markusenglund/react-switch#readme
- sounds from https://freesound.org/

## App features;

The app allows you to change the volume of the sounds, input by clicking the buttons and by pressing the indicated keys.
Besides, you can turn it off on the Switch element.

This app was based on a Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/) challenge with some adaptations - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine.

In this challenge I opted by using just React and SASS (of the mentioned libraries) and resources above, not other libraries (as Redux, Bootstrap and jQuery).
